# LOCTight

A simple, open-source program to keep your PC active and open for a specified amount of time, then automatically lock your computer.

## Why LOCTight?

LOCTight was inspired by a real-world need: a professor who struggled to keep their computer awake during lectures, but also wanted the machine to lock automatically when stepping away. This tool is designed to solve exactly that problem—keeping your computer awake when you need it, and locking it when you don't.
